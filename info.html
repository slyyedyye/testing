<h1> This page can hopefully provide further information on the LFI vulnerability. </h1>

<br />

<br />

<body>

<p> Local File Inclusion (LFI) is similar to a Remote File Inclusion vulnerability except instead of including remote files, only local files i.e. files on the current server can be included for execution. This issue can still lead to remote code execution by including a file that contains attacker-controlled data such as the web server's access logs. </p>

<br />

<h3>Some Common Locations for Capitalizing on LFI Vulnerabilities</h3>

<br />

<p>/var/log/apache2/access.log</p>

<p>/var/log/apache2/error.log</p>

<p>/etc/passwd</p>

<p>/proc/self/environ</p>

<p>... and more - but what fun would that be? :)</p>
